        <h2>Analytical and supportive — grounded in strategy, precision and measurable outcomes.</h2>
        <p><strong>Amy Sindicic helps government and military professionals transition into private-sector leadership roles</strong> by clarifying their value, strengthening their positioning, and aligning their résumés, LinkedIn profiles and interview strategies to today's market expectations.</p>
        <p>With expertise in career positioning, communication and executive branding, Amy helps federal, state and local professionals reframe their experience into market-ready narratives that align with private-sector expectations.</p>
        <p>Before career strategy, Amy spent decades as a university English professor, teaching professionals to communicate with clarity and precision. That background is why her clients sound different in interviews: their experience isn't just listed — it's argued.</p>
        <p>She has worked globally across four continents, supporting senior professionals in articulating complex experience with confidence. She has helped leaders secure competitive roles across industries and guided high-achieving professionals through demanding career pivots with structured strategy and measurable outcomes.</p>
        <p>She believes career growth — like physical training — requires discipline, strategy, accountability and consistent execution. <strong>Real transformation doesn't happen by accident.</strong></p>
